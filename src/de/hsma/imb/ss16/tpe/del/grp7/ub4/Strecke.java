 * This class represents a railroad track.
 * Every track has a certain length, which is set,
 * when the track is created. Any number of trains
 * can drive on a track, but they all drive in the
 * same direction. To coordinate the trains a track
 * consists of blocks. Blocks can have a different
 * length, but in total they can not exceed the tracks
 * length. A train can only enter a block, when this
 * block is free.
