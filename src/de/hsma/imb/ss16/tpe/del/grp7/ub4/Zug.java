 * This class represents a train, which can drive on a track.

 * his current position on the track as well as the block he is
 * in at a time and the next block. A train can only enter its
 * next block, when it is at the end of its current block and when
 * the next block is free. A train can also crash with
 * an other train in which case both trains will stop moving and
 * a SimulationException will be thrown.
